  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Making Markdown Readable and Your Default File Type</h2>

<p>So normally I don&#8217;t write tips on productivity, but lately I have been
focusing more and more on workflow and I decided to start diving deeper
into things like Brett Terpstra&#8217;s
<a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/">nvALT</a>, Smile&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a>, and Second
Gear&#8217;s <a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/">Elements</a> (ala <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/">Mac
Power Users</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to
Work</a> and <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin
Mann</a>). This means you may see so more stuff
from me regarding cool tools like these.</p>

<p>But this is a quick tip. So here it is:</p>

<p>When I installed nvALT there were two pieces that threw me right away.
First, even after going into the preferences and changing &#8220;Read notes
from folder&#8221; to the folder that had all my Markdown notes it didn&#8217;t
register any of them in the search.  The reason? I needed to change the
&#8220;Store and read notes on disk as&#8221; drop down from &#8220;Single Database&#8221; to
&#8220;Plain Text Files&#8221; and then I needed to add the file extension &#8220;md&#8221; to
the &#8220;Recognize individual files with attributes:&#8221; extensions. Check out
the screen capture below if this isn&#8217;t quite making sense. (Also note
that there is a &#8220;+&#8221; in that preference window, next to the &#8220;-&#8221; symbol,
but it isn&#8217;t showing right now in Lion.<a href="Many">^pe</a>)</p>

<p><img src="../images/nvALT-quick-tip-01.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The second item that started to bug me was that any new note/file that I
created was being created with the <code>.txt</code> extension instead of the <code>.md</code>
extension that I work in all the time now. Frankly, if I couldn&#8217;t fix
this issue, I would have probably abandoned nvALT almost right away.
Fortunately, I found that by selecting &#8220;md&#8221; in the &#8220;Recognize individual
files with attributes:&#8221; list and then hitting the check mark, it bolded
it and my tests have showed that all my new files being made by nvALT
are now <code>.md</code> files.</p>

<p>With these two items out of the way I plan to seriously play with this
system.</p>

<p>If, by some freakish chance Brett Terpstra checks out this post, one
feature request that I would make right now is to allow for the use of
his <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a> app for the preview instead of only
having the built in, but excellent, nvALT HTML preview. There&#8217;s a good
chance that it is already a feature and I&#8217;m not aware of it. I&#8217;m loving
Marked, and if you&#8217;re a Markdown person and not using it yet, you should
definitely check it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a> needed to do an update today. 6.0.2, I think. When I did the update the obligatory additional page was added to my tabs showing me that I was now fully updated. I was struck by the page, though:</p>

<p><img src="../images/little-details-01.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Of course I reloaded the page several times, and still the page looked the same. Now maybe I expect too much, but if you&#8217;re going to promote something then the promo should look good. The styling for the &#8220;Tabs, Meet Groups&#8221; promotion stands out for all the wrong reasons. The padding, the lack of easily findable links, and what is with the way &#8220;Name&#8221; and &#8220;Drag&#8221; are just hanging there?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure there is a simple explanation for this. It&#8217;s likely a css file that&#8217;s missing in a specific directory. But if you&#8217;re going to push this page after making me do an update, I&#8217;d make sure that it was 100%. Especially when you&#8217;re promoting something to make you stand out against other great browsers like <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have to say, I&#8217;m getting pretty jazzed about iOS5 coming out, and,
more specifically <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>. The video below was referenced by a <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/09/01/sync/">Practically
Efficient</a> article
that was building off a great article by <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2011/9/1/multi-platform-is-a-feature.html">David
Sparks</a>
regarding how iCloud will be the future to proper mulit-platform
computing. As David says in his article, when data just <em>is</em> then it
doesn&#8217;t matter what device you&#8217;re working on.</p>

<p>Why the video? John Gruber makes it very clear that the reason why data
can now just <em>be</em> is because Apple has worked its ass off to be a leader
in open web technologies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For the record, much of this is unabashedly lifted from <em>Pro Git</em> book I
can&#8217;t even remotely suggest that this content is original to me. Sure,
I&#8217;ve added my own two cents now and then, but do yourselves a favor and
read the first three chapters of <a href="http://progit.org/book">Pro Git</a>. In
fact, if any of this doesn&#8217;t make sense, it is probably because I
haven&#8217;t correctly paraphrased <em>Pro Git</em> and you should just consult the
book in that case.</p>

<p>One thing you&#8217;ll definitively need to use Git locally is Git running on
your computer. There are lots of tutorials and ways to do it, I think
<a href="http://progit.org/book/ch1-4.html">this tutorial</a> will work or you can
<a href="http://git-scm.com/">just go to the source</a> and download the latest
stable release of Git.</p>

<p>The other item that you&#8217;ll likely find useful in using Git as well as
for many other things, is a <a href="http://db.tt/eOrvceA">Dropbox account</a>. By
using Git in a Dropbox managed folder you get your own local repository
in the cloud. The Basic account type is free and comes with 2GB of
storage. That&#8217;s probably plenty if you plan to mainly do textish style
file management. If it isn&#8217;t enough space, hey, just get a paid account.
The service is awesome. The link that I give for the Dropbox account is
a referral link for me. It just me an extra 250MB of storage to my
account if you use it. If you&#8217;d rather not use that link then try
<a href="http://www.dropbox.com">http://www.dropbox.com</a>. I picked up this tip when I attended a
Webuquerque called <em>Getting With Git</em> that was presented by <a href="http://www.randomthink.net/">Brian
Arnold</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, this is not supposed to be a full explanation of how to use
Git. If you want that, as I said above, read the first few chapters of
<a href="http://progit.org/book">Pro Git</a>. The purpose of this is to touch on
basics of getting started and some of the more common commands. I used
Git while writing this document and I really enjoyed its simplicity.
From my perspective, this is worth your time to understand.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was asked to give a bunch of detail on a server that I use so that I could request permission to participate in migrating some of the web work I do onto a new CMS. The requests seemed fine, but the form provided no way of easily estimating the file numbers they requested. I used these linux commands to find the details I needed:</p>

<p><code>find . -type f -name '*.php' | wc -l</code> gave me the number of files I had in the directory with .php file extensions.</p>

<p><code>du /var/www/html/ -ch | grep total</code> gave me the total amount of disk space being used in the directory in &#8220;human readable&#8221; format.</p>

<p><code>/sbin/ifconfig</code> gave me the ip address of the server the information was currently sitting on.</p>

<p>I had to look up the first one, I didn&#8217;t know how to get down to that sort of granularity, but I think the others are worthy of documenting here in case someone finds some use in them.</p>

<p>I was then informed about this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Fun fact: &#8220;find -name -type&#8221; is way faster than &#8220;find -type -name&#8221; because it avoids doing a stat() call if the name doesn&#8217;t match. stat() on a file that isn&#8217;t already in RAM likely triggers a seek and can take beaucoup milliseconds.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which is an awesome tip from a person who had been reading the blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something I wanted to get under my belt this year was to take on a
significant role in an open source project. I&#8217;ve built a major part of
my career around the results of open source work: I am a PHP programmer
and I rarely work in any other environment other than Linux, and it
would be nice to be able to give something back to that community that
has helped put food on my table.</p>

<p>There are a lot of options out there. <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>
seemed like a natural fit for me, as I&#8217;ve spent a significant part of
the last several months honing my Drupal skills. But what I really want
to do is build my experience in another programming language while
working on an open source project.</p>

<p>Another goal I had this year was to build an expertise in Objective-C,
but Objective-C open source projects are hard to find. I&#8217;m also
interested in building on my Ruby skills and my Python skills, but Ruby
over Python.</p>

<p>So with these requirements, I&#8217;m going to spend time looking for a Ruby
open source project that I&#8217;ll be able to join in on.</p>

<p>There are a couple of other pieces to this undertaking for me, though.
The first is to get a feel for the open source community. Frankly, I
don&#8217;t know it as well as I would like. I know how I do code reviews in
my own work, and I also know what it means to commit to a project in my
own mind, but I want to get a better understanding of how it works in a
community open source project, as it will likely be rather different
than what I&#8217;m used to.</p>

<p>The other piece is where to find a project that will suit my interests.
I plan on starting my search in <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, but I
haven&#8217;t ruled out <a href="http://sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a>. Regardless,
when I find something I&#8217;ll mention my work on it here. Frankly, I
haven&#8217;t given up on the idea of working on a Drupal module either. But
if anyone knows of an interesting project that wouldn&#8217;t mind having a
slightly better than novice Ruby programmer who is interested in
starting small with some doing some bug fixes, let me know.</p>

<p>More on this soon, I hope. And I apologize in advance if I decide to use
this forum to point to interesting potential projects.</p>
