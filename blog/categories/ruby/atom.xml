    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Contrary to the date listed, the <a href="http://blog.geoffpetrie.com/blog/2012/09/25/python-dictionaries/">previous post</a> about Python and dictionaries and PHP and associative arrays was written a few weeks back. I've since been spending more time with Ruby than with Python since.</p>

<p>After posting that article about how tight the Python code was in order to build a string with just the right number of semicolons, I decided to see if I could do the same thing with Ruby.</p>

<p>This is the solution I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>hash = {"server"=&gt;"gpetrie", "database"=&gt;"localhost", "uid"=&gt;"sa", "pwd"=&gt;"secret"}

hash.each do |key, val|
  if hash.length == 1
    print "#{key}=#{val}\n"
  else
    print "#{key}=#{val}; "
    hash.delete(key)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I think I'm missing something here that would make this code much tighter. This looks very similar to the PHP code that I wrote as the solution in my previous article. There's got to be a method that I'm not using that would allow me to dismiss the <code>delete</code> and the <code>hash.length</code> that I am using.</p>
