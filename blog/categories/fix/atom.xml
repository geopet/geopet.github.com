    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the longest time I could not get Webrick to work for me. It would boot up with <code>rails s</code> but would take several seconds for even the default landing page of a rails app to load. It was terrible.</p>

<p>I resorted to using <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a> as my default browser by making sure it was in all my Gem files, but I still wanted to figure out why Webrick simply wouldn't work for me. (Truth is, Thin is a better web server, but I still wanted to get Webrick to work for me.)</p>

<p>Searching for "webrick slow" brought up a possible solution via <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3465134/887078">Stack Overflow</a>. Basically you change the <code>:DoNotReverseLookup</code> symbol in your global Webrick config from <code>nil</code> to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>If you're on OS X Lion you'll find the Webrick configuration here:</p>

<p><code>~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p362/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/config.rb</code></p>

<p>I found the <code>:DoNotReverseLookup</code> configuration on line 36.</p>

<p>Once I made the change Webrick was screaming fast. I'm pretty happy about it.</p>

<p>I still haven't found the definitive reason why this problem is occurring, but at least this change appears to fix things for me.</p>

<hr />

<p>Please note, depending on the version of Ruby you're running <code>ruby-1.9.3-p362</code> could be something different. Just as long as you're changing the <code>confg.rb</code> file in the <code>webrick/</code> directory, you should be fine.</p>
