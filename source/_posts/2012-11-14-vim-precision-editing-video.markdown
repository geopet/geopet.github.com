[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) is my text editor of choice. Drew Neil is an
amazing Vim evangelist. If you haven't, you should go check out
[VimCasts](http://vimcasts.org/). He also [has a book](http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim) that I haven't had a
chance to dive into yet, but I will be shortly.

If you haven't yet, you should check out Drew Neil's presentation on
Vim. 

The first chunk, if you're good with Vim, isn't anything you don't
already know. It is mainly Drew trying to convince people that modality
in a text editor is great. I agree. It is.

But about midway through, Drew busts out some of great power moves.
Some of them I've not seen before, but I have immediately introduced to
muscle memory workout.

The three that I picked up from this were:

1. `dt.` - delete until the dot.
2. `vi[` - visually highlight everything between the square bracket.
3. `gf` - go to the file under the cursor.

Honestly, I don't know how I never picked up `gf` before, but I promise
it is one that I won't forget. The other two I'm in love with. I used
`dt.` while writing this post!

Anyway, here's the presentation. Give it a look:
