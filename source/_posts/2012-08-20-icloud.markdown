I have to say, I'm getting pretty jazzed about iOS5 coming out, and,
more specifically [iCloud](http://www.apple.com/icloud/). The video below was referenced by a [Practically
Efficient](http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/09/01/sync/) article
that was building off a great article by [David
Sparks](http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2011/9/1/multi-platform-is-a-feature.html)
regarding how iCloud will be the future to proper mulit-platform
computing. As David says in his article, when data just *is* then it
doesn't matter what device you're working on.

Why the video? John Gruber makes it very clear that the reason why data
can now just *be* is because Apple has worked its ass off to be a leader
in open web technologies.
