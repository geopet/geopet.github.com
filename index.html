  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another quick tip for people using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>:</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re running Octopress on Mac OSX you may be running into some real
performance issues when you run the <code>rake preview</code> command to check your
posts locally before you run the <code>rake deploy</code> to get things up and
running live. This is because, for whatever reason, the
<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/webrick/rdoc/index.html">WEBrick</a> server runs slowly on
XCode 4.2+. I haven&#8217;t dived deep into finding a solution for this
because I found a nice fix.</p>

<p>First, run <code>gem install thin</code> from your command line.</p>

<p>This command will install the <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Ruby Thin Server</a>. This server is what I use
for my Rails testing as well and it works exactly the way I want it to.
(I have read many recommendations on using <a href="http://pow.cx/">Pow</a> as
well, but I haven&#8217;t spent the time looking into it so I can&#8217;t personally
recommend it yet.)</p>

<p>The next step is to change your <code>Gemfile</code> located in the top directory
of your Octopress files.  Simply add <code>gem 'thin'</code> to the development
group and save the changes.</p>

<p>This is what your <code>Gemfile</code> should look like now if you&#8217;re running
Octopress 2.0 without any changes up to this point:</p>

<p>The next time you run <code>rake preview</code> your blog on
<a href="http://localhost:4000">http://localhost:4000</a> should run smooth as silk on the Thin server.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>File this under the <em>I&#8217;m always referencing this, so I&#8217;m going to do a
quick post about it</em> category.</p>

<p>Tagging in Git is super powerful and can save your butt. Here are a few
commands that I use often but never seem to remember.</p>

<p><strong>List</strong> all your tags:</p>

<p><code>git tag</code></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Create</strong> a tag:</p>

<p><code>git tag -a v1.4</code></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Push</strong> tags:</p>

<p><code>git push origin v1.4</code></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><code>git push origin --tags</code></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Checkout</strong> a tag:</p>

<p><code>git checkout -b v1.4</code></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Deleting</strong> a tag</p>

<p><code>git tag -d v1.4</code></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Deleting</strong> a <em>remote</em> tag</p>

<p><code>git push origin :v1.4</code></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Search</strong> for <em>specific</em> tags:</p>

<p><code>git tag -l 'v1.0.2'</code></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>See</strong> tag <em>data</em>:</p>

<p><code>git show v1.4</code></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Retroactively</strong> tag:</p>

<p><code>git tag -a v1.4 &lt;&lt;checksum&gt;&gt;</code></p>

<hr />

<p>A couple of nice references on tagging:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Because I can&#8217;t seem to let this go, I continued to research the
challenge I was dealing with a <a href="http://blog.geoffpetrie.com/blog/2012/09/25/the-ruby-hashes-case/">few days back</a>
where I was trying to get the <a href="http://blog.geoffpetrie.com/blog/2012/09/25/python-dictionaries/">cool python trick</a>
to work with Ruby hashes.</p>

<p>After scrubbing the Ruby documentation a more carefully, it seems that
Ruby hashes and Python dictionaries are not entirely identical.  Most
importantly, Ruby hashes don&#8217;t have the same string methods that Python
dictionaries do. Meaning: Ruby hashes and Python dictionaries, while
similar, may be more of an apples and oranges sort of comparison.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I tried to trim up the code I wrote the last time to
produce the same output. This is what I came up with:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>The New Semi-Colon Goodness semicolon2.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rb'><span class='line'><span class="nb">hash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;server&quot;</span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="s2">&quot;gpetrie&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;database&quot;</span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="s2">&quot;localhost&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;uid&quot;</span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="s2">&quot;sa&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;pwd&quot;</span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="s2">&quot;secret&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">Array</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">hash</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">val</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">arr</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">=</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What I&#8217;m doing here is forcing myself to work within the confines of the
initial premiss that the values are given to me in a hash. I convert the
hash to an array and then use the join method on the array to do what I
want to do to get the output that I want. <em>Semi-colon success achieved!</em></p>

<p>I think we can generally agree that this is better than the option I
proposed previously:</p>

<p>For my money, the new snippet is much more readable and is just a smidge
more compact. A win on all sides.</p>

<p>I probably won&#8217;t be returning to this subject again in the near term
(unless I find out I&#8217;m totally wrong here), but expect more Ruby focused
conversation coming up regularly here while I work my way through the
language.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Contrary to the date listed, the <a href="http://blog.geoffpetrie.com/blog/2012/09/25/python-dictionaries/">previous post</a> about Python and dictionaries and PHP and associative arrays was written a few weeks back. I&#8217;ve since been spending more time with Ruby.</p>

<p>After posting that article about how tight the Python code was in order to build a string with just the right number of semicolons, I decided to see if I could do the same thing with Ruby.</p>

<p>This is the solution I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>hash = {"server"=&gt;"gpetrie", "database"=&gt;"localhost", "uid"=&gt;"sa", "pwd"=&gt;"secret"}

hash.each do |key, val|
  if hash.length == 1
    print "#{key}=#{val}\n"
  else
    print "#{key}=#{val}; "
    hash.delete(key)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I think I&#8217;m missing something here that would make this code much tighter. This looks very similar to the PHP code that I wrote as the solution in my previous article. There&#8217;s got to be a method that I&#8217;m not using that would allow me to dismiss the <code>delete</code> and the <code>hash.length</code> that I am using.</p>

<p>If you have thoughts or suggestions, hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/geopet">Twitter</a> and let me know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you read my previous post on <a href="http://blog.geoffpetrie.com/blog/2012/08/29/on-the-problems-of-education-in-a-developers-world/">the challenge of education as a developer</a>, you&#8217;ll know about my interested in the Python language and syntax. I have had a reason to look at Python again recently and it&#8217;s pretty amazing what I had forgotten about the language.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;ll admit that my understanding of object models and design patterns isn&#8217;t the finest. But as I was going through my Python refresher I had a bit of an aha moment.</p>

<p>It was this line of code that struck me as pretty significant:</p>

<pre><code>return ";".join(["%s=%s" % (k, v) for k, v in params.items()])
</code></pre>

<p>This code came from the <a href="http://www.diveintopython.net/native_data_types/summary.html">Dive into Python</a> website.</p>

<p>While it doesn&#8217;t look remarkable on the surface, knowing that <em>everything in Python is an object</em> (like Ruby and Javascript) you&#8217;ll appreciate how cool that line of code is. Specifically the <code>";"</code> piece of it.</p>

<p>That <code>.join</code> method is called <em>by</em> that semicolon. That&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the importance of this piece, I decided to see how I could actually produce the same results that line of code does in PHP.</p>

<p>So that you understand the whole piece to this, the <code>params</code> variable is actually a dictionary (aka, an associative array in PHP) created in a small module. The variable is:</p>

<pre><code>params = {"server":"gpetrie", \
          "database":"localhost", \
          "uid":"sa", \
          "pwd":"secret" \
         }
</code></pre>

<p>The output from <code>return ";".join(["%s=%s" % (k, v) for k, v in params.items()])</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>pwd=secret;database=localhost;uid=sa;server=gpetrie
</code></pre>

<p>So the piece we&#8217;re going to focus on is how that last tuple is printed. You see that? <code>server=gpetrie</code>. There&#8217;s no semicolon at the end of that. That&#8217;s because the semicolon is the object calling the <code>.join</code> method.</p>

<p>How can I produce this same output using PHP and an associative array?</p>

<p>If I were to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$myParams = array("server"=&gt;"gpetrie", 
                  "database"=&gt;"localhost", 
                  "uid"=&gt;"sa", 
                  "pwd"=&gt;"secret");
</code></pre>

<p>to initialize the PHP script, and then follow it up with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$str = "";

foreach ($myParams as $k=&gt;$v) {
  $str .= "$k:$v; "
}  

print_r($str);
</code></pre>

<p>We wouldn&#8217;t get what we wanted. We&#8217;d get this:</p>

<pre><code>server:gpetrie; database:localhost; uid:sa; pwd:secret; 
</code></pre>

<p>That semicolon at the end. That&#8217;s the problem.</p>

<p>So we try something a little more complex:</p>

<pre><code>$myParams = array("server"=&gt;"gpetrie", 
                  "database"=&gt;"localhost", 
                  "uid"=&gt;"sa", 
                  "pwd"=&gt;"secret");

$arrayCount = count($myParams);
$arrayKeys  = array_keys($myParams);

for ($i=0; $i&lt;$arrayCount; $i++) {
  $arrayKey = $arrayKeys[$i];
  $str .= $arrayKey.':'.$myParams[$arrayKey].';';
}

print_r($str);
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn&#8217;t work either. We get:</p>

<pre><code>server:gpetrie; database:localhost; uid:sa; pwd:secret; 
</code></pre>

<p>as our output.</p>

<p>That <em>semicolon</em>!!!</p>

<p>Now I could be way off here. There is likely a far more elegant solution to this than I did, but this is the solution I came up with to produce the same output as the one line from Python:</p>

<pre><code>$myParams = array("server"=&gt;"gpetrie", 
                  "database"=&gt;"localhost", 
                  "uid"=&gt;"sa", 
                  "pwd"=&gt;"secret");

for ($i=0; $i&lt;=$arrayCount--; $i++) {
  $arrayKey = $arrayKeys[$i];
  $str .= $arrayKey.':'.$myParams[$arrayKey].';';
  unset($myParams[$arrayKey]);
}

$str .= key($myParams).':'.$myParams[key($myParams)];

print_r($str);
</code></pre>

<p>And now we get the result we want:</p>

<pre><code>server:gpetrie;database:localhost;uid:sa;pwd:secret
</code></pre>

<p>No semicolon at the end.</p>

<p>Now don&#8217;t misunderstand the point of this. This isn&#8217;t a Python versus PHP thing. This is just to show the interesting power of having everything as an object in Python and how much lighter your code can be because of it. Of course if you have a better solution to this than I do, please let me know. I&#8217;d love to see it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/git-prune.jpg" title="[pruning the stale branches]" ></p>

<p>I have multiple places where I work and I use <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> to support that. The general Git workflow I&#8217;ve adopted is similar to the one <a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">Scott Chacon describes</a>.</p>

<p>In Scott&#8217;s post he explains that anything in <code>master</code> is deployable, and any time you want to work on something you branch from <code>master</code> with something descriptively named. This is what I want to talk about now.</p>

<p>I use this process of branching to keep my changes manageable. By naming my branches descriptively I know that if I&#8217;m building a new user profiling tool, and changing the css of a navigational piece and updating a SQL query in the same branch, then the commit isn&#8217;t going to be terribly clean. Plus, now the branch has no meaning to me when I get feedback from a tester. This branch would make even less sense if I had someone else coding with me.</p>

<p>To keep branches meaningful I make a lot of branches off of <code>master</code>. I&#8217;ve come to the standard practice of pushing pretty much <em>any</em> branch I&#8217;m working on, no matter how minor, to the remote. This makes it simple to <code>fetch</code> and <code>merge</code> on my dev server instance instead of scp&#8217;ing the work I&#8217;ve done to the server. The process is just feels a little crisper.</p>

<p>After the testers have given the thumbs up on the work and I do my final code review, I merge the branch to master, push it out to production and delete that feature/bugfix branch. All-in-all it is a generally good system.</p>

<p>But what inevitably happens is the dev server has a bunch of branches that are no longer useful and don&#8217;t have a remote counterpart to them. It gets to be a bit of a mess when you run <code>git branch</code> and see a dozen old branches sitting there.</p>

<p>To fix this issue I found a great, quick command:</p>

<p><code>git remote prune origin</code></p>

<p>Where <code>origin</code> is the name of the remote.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote.html">From the manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>prune</strong></p>

<p><code>git remote prune [-n | --dry-run] &lt;name&gt;</code></p>

<p>Deletes all stale remote-tracking branches under <code>&lt;name&gt;</code>. These stale branches have already been removed from the remote repository referenced by <code>&lt;name&gt;</code>, but are still locally available in <code>"remotes/&lt;name&gt;"</code>.</p>

<p>With <code>--dry-run</code> option, report what branches will be pruned, but do not actually prune them.</p></blockquote>

<p><code>prune</code> is one of those commands that you may not use very often, but it is nice to know it&#8217;s there when you need it.</p>

<p><strong>Endnote:</strong></p>

<p>I found this particular <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3994587/887078">Stack Overflow</a> answer useful when I was looking for information on how to handle dead remote branches.</p>

<h2>How the Learning Voice Needs to Roundhouse Kick the Work Voice in the Face</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/on_the_problems_of_education_in_a_developers_world-loc-classroom.jpg" title="N.Y. schools opening" alt="N.Y. schools opening"></p>

<p><strong>Preface:</strong></p>

<p>As a little background, I wrote the post below about a week or two ago. I&#8217;ve been sitting on it since.</p>

<p>The gist of the post is about my frustration in trying to get better or even keep up with skills and tools. I was blaming my deadlines and commitments for getting in the way.</p>

<p>While I was writing this post I came to the realization that only <em>I</em> could really make a difference in the jammed feeling I had. Deadlines will never go away. Commitments will never end. If I really wanted to pick up and understand something, then <em>I</em> had to make that happen for myself. No one else would do that for me.</p>

<p>So in the past couple of weeks I started to look at <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and then I rebuilt my <a href="http://geoffpetrie.com">personal site</a> on it. (Bootstrap is amazing. I can&#8217;t recommend it more highly.) I took a couple of hours and got <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> in place and moved my more substantial writing from my old <a href="http://faceofgeoff.com">Tumblr</a> and put it in place <em>right</em> here. Additionally, I have started to take a more serious look at Python again. I also started to build and put up on GitHub a little <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> journal service pack that I&#8217;m having a ball building. Finally, I&#8217;m also seriously looking at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas">Canvas</a> and I am trying to figure out a way to prototype a Canvas web app that uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebSockets">WebSockets</a>.</p>

<p>This effort has significantly improved my spirit. I&#8217;m feeling creative and rejuvenated. While the deadlines haven&#8217;t gone away, I feel like I&#8217;m not deadline bound in my day any more. There are tons of new project possibilities out there now. It&#8217;s invigorating.</p>

<p>I had considered dumping this post entirely, but I thought it might be worth posting just to see where my head was at when I wrote this a few weeks back. I know I&#8217;m not the only person who gets in these sorts of ruts. Maybe this will resonate with someone else and they&#8217;ll be able to pull themselves into their creative zone like I seem to be doing now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This option isn&#8217;t terribly well explained in the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">Octopress documentation</a>, and slightly confusing within the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages">Github</a>.</p>

<p>So that I could get <em>blog.geoffpetrie.com</em> to work as my url to my Octopress blog hosted by Github at <em>geopet.github.com</em>, I needed to go to my current hosting service. In my case this is currently <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?1197623">Dreamhost</a>.</p>

<p>Since I wasn&#8217;t changing my top-level domain (TLD), I wanted to keep <em>geoffpetrie.com</em> pointed at my hosting service, I wanted to add a subdomain, i.e., <em>blog</em> to my domain name server (DNS) run by Dreamhost.</p>

<p>I went into the DNS configuration in the Dreamhost cpanel and added <em>blog</em> as the <strong>name/record</strong>, <em>CNAME</em> as the <strong>type</strong> and <em>geopet.github.com</em> as the <strong>value</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the first step, and once the DNS is refreshed your new subdomain (in my case <em>blog.geoffpetrie.com</em>) will start pointing to a Github 404.</p>

<p>The next step is to add the CNAME to your Octopress <em>master</em> branch. This is surprisingly simple, but not completely intuitive. In the top level of the <em>source</em> branch, you want to use the command:</p>

<p><code>echo 'blog.geoffpetrie.com' &gt;&gt; source/CNAME</code></p>

<p>Of course you&#8217;re going to use your own subdomain instead of <em>blog.geoffpetrie.com</em>. This command will create the CNAME file in your source directory with the url that you want to direct people to.</p>

<p>After this all that&#8217;s needed is <code>rake generate</code> and <code>rake deploy</code>. (You may as well commit to your source branch after this.)</p>

<p>Wait a couple of minutes for things to work their way through DNS and Github&#8217;s world and you&#8217;ll be looking at your Octopress blog on your own domain.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Moving my <a href="http://faceofgeoff.com">Tumblr</a> to <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress">Octopress</a> seems to be a bit more of a chore than I had initially expected. My journey into <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> turned out to be something that required more time that I could commit at this very moment, so I decided to take a quicker path to getting a better blogging workflow into my life by implementing some really exceptional work done <a href="http://brandonmathis.com/">Brandon Mathis</a> in Octopress as recommended by my friend <a href="http://brianarn.github.com/">Brian Arnold</a>.</p>

<p>Still, this is a new application that I haven&#8217;t had a chance to really kick the tires on. I tried to grab the less family specific pieces from the Tumblr I kept, and the more bloggy pieces from there. There is more work to be done on that front. For one, I need to get some of the original images from there for the technical pieces that I took screen captures of. In the mean time I&#8217;ll see if I can get URLs back to the original Tumblr pieces if there is any interest in that at all.</p>

<p>While I would love to spend time tweaking this install of Octopress, I suspect that I&#8217;ll spend the time I do have writing rather than tweaking for the moment. Forward progression is key for me right now, even though this is something I should dive deeper into.</p>

<p>If I ignore what I said above and fall into the abyss, I will post the tricks I find along the way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So at the end of last month (July 20, 2012) there was a disturbance in the indie developer force when the great iOS/OS X gmail skin/email client Sparrow was acquired by Google.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll provide the text of their announcement at the end of this which you can (at the time of this writing) find <a href="http://sprw.me/">on their site</a>. The gist of the press release was that they&#8217;d been bought by Google, that they&#8217;d do one more bug fix and then they&#8217;d stop working on the Apple products and start working on other Gmail stuff for Google. As a side note, it was amusing to see the long list of &#8220;advisors&#8221; and investors that they thanked as well.</p>

<p>Of course my initial reaction was disappointment. The iOS app they built was light-years ahead of the native Apple client and I found that the desktop client was a nice departure from OSX Mail. I was also excited when I saw they were heading toward a Sparrow iPad app. But, you know, Google apparently offered them all jobs and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/20/3172365/sources-google-sparrow-25-million-gmail-client">something around $25 million</a> for them to stop working on their product.</p>

<p>A large part of the chatter regarding this buyout was the argument that it is <em>really</em> hard to make it as an independent developer. There was also talk about how $25M really isn&#8217;t that much money when all is said and done. And how this was something along the lines of a talent acquisition. I would agree with all of this.</p>

<p>But after the dust has settled what we still have is this great small software group that was given enough to stop building for Apple. And this got me thinking, and you&#8217;ll probably think I&#8217;m crazy, but I started to wonder if this could be a new business model for Google?</p>

<p>And before you call bullshit on me, just consider it for a moment. Google is lousy at UI. Just look at how they screwed up Gmail and Reader. Sparrow is beautiful. It’s one of the reasons I enjoyed using it so much. Google is also working their asses off to make Android a legit contender to iOS. Some will say that Android is already competitive with iOS. I&#8217;m not going to waste my time with this argument. Furthermore, Google’s Android OS has a huge piracy issue on their hands right now, so many devs aren&#8217;t interested in spending their time to watch their work be stolen by douchebags who won&#8217;t drop $3.99 for their year and a half of work.</p>

<p>So if you were one of the most wealthy companies on the planet and you were losing out due to lack of developer interest and a general lack of impacting talent in the UI department, why wouldn&#8217;t you bring excellent UI and mobile app developers in house to make kick ass products for your own OS? Why wouldn&#8217;t you start to cherry pick some of the exceptional talent that is out in the iOS space?</p>

<p>I think it is possible that this is the beginning of a few other talent grabs by Google. I wouldn&#8217;t be shocked if we saw the end of <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> and possibly <a href="http://vemedio.com/products/instacast">Instacast</a> (although I prefer <a href="http://www.downcastapp.com/">Downcast</a> for podcast players but Instacast seems to get the lion&#8217;s share of mentions), and I  hope that the <a href="http://tapbots.com/">Tapbot</a> folk or the <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> guys don&#8217;t get caught in this as well. But by taking on this model, Google gets rid of the lousy Android piracy issue by giving these developers a massive hiring bonus and it gives them a regular paycheck for as long as they want to be Google employees. They never have to sell another app in a market again, but they get to keep building for the platform they love. I wouldn&#8217;t blame anyone for accepting something like that. Plus, if Google makes this a culture thing, who&#8217;s to say what else may change because of it?</p>

<p>If this really becomes a thing, it will be interesting to see what Apple does as a response.</p>
